When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To be able to share the repository with other people (or perhaps machines) including possibly letting others commit changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not be ready to either merge other changes into your local repository or simply receive updates at the time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork "clones" a repository from one GitHub account to another.  Use to, for example, take someone elses work and modify it on your own repository.
Clone makes a copy of a repository either locally or on GitHub.  Unlike fork, does not create a link to source of the clone.
Branch is used on a particular repository to create a different "branch" to work on simultaneously from other branches for things like new features, experimentation, etc.
