When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To be able to share the repository with other people (or perhaps machines) including possibly letting others commit changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not be ready to either merge other changes into your local repository or simply receive updates at the time.
